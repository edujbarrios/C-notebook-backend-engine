# C Notebook Backend Engine

![ON DEVELOPMENT](https://img.shields.io/badge/ON%20DEVELOPMENT-001f4d?style=for-the-badge)

## Description

This project is a **pure terminal prototype** of a *****C-based notebook infrastructure*****. It allows you to create, edit, and execute sequential C code blocks called cells. The cells are stored as part of a structured notebook file using the custom state of the art **`.cnb`** file extension.

> [!WARNING]
> This is strictly a backend demonstration for a *****proof-of-concept*****. The full-featured C notebook infrastructure developed by myself is maintained privately for usability and product reasons.

## Project Purpose

- Validate the execution model for sequentially concatenated C code cells.
- Validate save/load mechanics for notebook files using `.cnb` custom format.

## How It Works

1. Each cell contains a snippet of C code.
2. All cells are concatenated together into a temporary C file inside `/memory/`.
3. The program compiles and executes the combined code.
4. The results of each cell are displayed and stored.

## Installation and Build

### Requirements:
- GCC Compiler
- Make

### Download repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edujbarrios/C-notebook-backend-engine/
cd C-notebook-backend-engine
```


### Build Instructions:

```bash
make
```

### Run:

```bash
./cnb
```

## Folder Structure

```
include/        → Header files
src/            → Source files
output_cnbs/    → Saved notebooks with .cnb extension
memory/         → Temporary compilation and execution files
Makefile        → Build script
README.md       → This file
```

## Commands (Inside Terminal UI)

- `:save` → Saves the current notebook. You will be asked for a filename.
- `:load` → Loads the default notebook file (`examples/notebook.cnb`).
- `:exit` → Exits the program.

## Custom File Extension: `.cnb`

Notebooks are saved using the `.cnb` extension, standing for **C Notebook**.

A `.cnb` file contains:
- The number of cells.
- The code and output of each cell.
- A human-readable but structured format.

### Example File Content:

```
CNOTEBOOK
CELLS:2
---
int total = 10;
<<<
Starting total: 10
---
---
total += 5;
printf("Total: %d", total);
<<<
Total: 15
---
```

## Complex example: DNA sequence

Here's a "complex" example of a saved `.cnb` file after sequentially adding separate cells:

> [!NOTE]
> The *<<<* represents the outputs of the cells in the self creted `.cnb` files.
> More complex cells can be done and work as a real Jupyter Notebook for C, but to do that, it's needed to develop a custom frontend. **This mentioned part is done but remains private.**

double gc_percent = (double)gc / (gc + at) * 100.0;
printf("DNA sequence: %s\n", dna);
printf("GC-content: %.2f%%\n", gc_percent);

DNA sequence: ATGCGATTACGATCAGCGATCG

strcpy(dna, "GGCCATGATTTAGGGGCCC");
gc = 0;

for(i = 0; dna[i] != '\0'; i++) {
    if (dna[i] == 'G' || dna[i] == 'C') gc++;
    if (dna[i] == 'A' || dna[i] == 'T') at++;
}
gc_percent = (double)gc / (gc + at) * 100.0;
printf("New DNA: %s\nGC-content: %.2f%%\n", dna, gc_percent);

<<<
DNA sequence: ATGCGATTACGATCAGCGATCG
GC-content: 50.00%
New DNA: GGCCATGATTTAGGGGCCC
GC-content: 63.16%
